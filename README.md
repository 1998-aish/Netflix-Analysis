# 📊 Netflix Data Analysis Project

This project is a comprehensive data analysis of Netflix's content library using Python and popular data analysis libraries like **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**. The goal is to explore trends in Netflix’s catalog and extract actionable insights about genres, content types, production countries, and more.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a publicly available CSV file sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows), which contains information on all the movies and TV shows available on Netflix as of the dataset's collection date. It includes fields like:

* Title
* Type (Movie or TV Show)
* Director, Cast
* Country
* Date Added
* Release Year
* Rating
* Duration
* Genre (Listed in ‘listed\_in’ column)

## 🎯 Objectives

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and distribution of Netflix content
* Clean and preprocess the data (handle nulls, split multi-valued fields like genres)
* Visualize key trends, such as:

  * Most popular genres on Netflix
  * Distribution of content type over the years
  * Countries contributing the most content
  * Ratings distribution
  * Duration analysis for movies and shows
* Identify content gaps or patterns that could be useful for recommendation systems or strategic decisions

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* Python
* pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
* Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
* Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

## 📌 Key Insights

* The majority of Netflix's content is movies, with a rising trend in original TV shows.
* United States, India, and the UK dominate content production.
* Drama is the most common genre, often paired with international content.
* A large portion of content is suitable for family or teen audiences.

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn

* How to clean and wrangle real-world streaming datasets
* How to visualize trends in time-based and categorical data
* How to interpret and present findings in a structured and impactful way

This project is ideal for data science beginners who want hands-on experience with exploratory data analysis and storytelling with data. Feel free to fork this repo and extend it with recommendation engines, clustering by genre, or dashboarding with tools like Power BI or Streamlit!
